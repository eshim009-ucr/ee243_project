\section*{Key Publication}

In \citetitle{main}, \citeauthor{main} implement handwritten digit recognition
using the MNIST dataset on a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA. Their primary goal is to
reduce the usage of hardware resources and power consumption of the system while
maintaining acceptable performance.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \citeauthor{madineni2023parameterizable} propose a system implemented
	in the new Chisel hardware design language that claims improvements over
	\citetitle{main} and several similar implementation.
	\item \citeauthor{baedorf2023reverse} reference \citetitle{main} as a method
	of classification that was passed over for neural network analysis of
	abnormal breathing.
	\item \citeauthor{phipps2023pre} contrast the performance of
	\citetitle{main} against other similar models.
	\item \citeauthor*{pistellato2023quantization} and \citeauthor*{yan2023end}
	use \citetitle{main} as an example of techniques by which performance of
	neural networks on FPGAs can be improved.
