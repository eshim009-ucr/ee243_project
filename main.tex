\section*{Key Publication}

In \citetitle*{main}\autocite{main}, \citeauthor{main} implement handwritten
digit recognition using the MNIST dataset on a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA. Their
primary goal is to reduce the usage of hardware resources and power consumption
of the system while maintaining acceptable performance.


\section*{Topic Introduction}

The high power usage of most CNN implementations limits their viability for
battery-powered applications. Additionally, large and expensive acceleration
hardware like GPUs limits their viability for consumer applications. Increasing
power efficiency and decreasing component cost would allow these models to be
deployed far more widely.
