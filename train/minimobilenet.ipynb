    "Fill in object class named `ConvNet` in `cnn_model.py`. Youâ€™ll define the network layers in the method `__init__` and the forward pass in the method `forward`. We create an instance of `ConvNet` in `train.py`, which takes a tensor with dimension $(B, 3, 32, 32)$ as an input, where $B$ is the batch size. The output should be a matrix of dimension $(B, 10)$ representing the confidence (before applying the softmax function) for the 10 categories. Your CNN should have 4 convolutional layers with ReLU, Dropout, Batch Normalization and Max pooling operations in each (if required), followed by a linear layer and then a classifier layer at the end. You can use the function `_initialize_weight` in `ConvNet` to initialize weights of the convolutional layers. You are allowed to choose stride, weight decay, dropout rate, filter kernel size, number of output feature maps for each layer and other hyper-parameters. FYI: A 4 layer network (written properly) should be able to obtain at least an accuracy of 65% on the test set."
